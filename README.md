Introduction

Welcome to the Machine Learning Capstone Project, a complete exploration of the machine learning lifecycleâ€”from data preparation to model implementation and evaluation. This project demonstrates best practices in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying ML models to derive actionable insights.

Project Overview

Data Collection: Collected datasets including customer reviews, restaurant details, and other relevant attributes.
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, cleaned data, and prepared it for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Created new features, removed redundant ones, and applied text preprocessing techniques to enhance data quality.
ML Model Implementation: Implemented K-Means Clustering and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for insights and topic modeling.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated models using metrics such as Silhouette Score, ROC-AUC, precision, and recall.
Preprocessing Data
Collected reviews, restaurant information, and other relevant data.
Performed extensive data cleaning and missing value handling.

Applied text preprocessing:

Expanded contractions
Lowercased text
Removed punctuation, URLs, digits, stopwords, and extra whitespace

Feature Engineering

Created new features to reduce multicollinearity.
Performed sentiment analysis on reviews (positive/negative classification based on average ratings).
Log-transformed the 'Cost' feature to correct positive skewness.

ML Model Implementation

1. K-Means Clustering:

Clustered data into 6 groups to understand patterns in restaurant features.

2. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):

Applied topic modeling to extract meaningful insights from customer reviews.

Conclusion

Improved clustering results by carefully selecting the number of clusters (K).
Fine-tuned the LDA model for better topic modeling and higher Silhouette Scores.
Conducted extensive model evaluation using metrics like ROC-AUC, precision, and recall.
